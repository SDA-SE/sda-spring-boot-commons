    The [sda-spring-boot-commons](https://github.com/SDA-SE/sda-spring-boot-commons) library
    includes several modules to speed up SDA-compliant microservice development. It is
    based on the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework. It provides
    several starter modules for additional functionality. Those starter modules configure the
    framework with default SDA specific settings and add support for an easy and fast integration
    of standard technologies such as MongoDB, S3 or Kafka.
